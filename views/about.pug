            | I am currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Information Systems at the University of Houston in Houston, TX.  
            |  I have decided to spend my spare time pursuing new skills to enhance my university learning experience. 
            |  An example of this is pursuing my Treehouse Full-Stack TechDegree online, during which I have broadened my skills, 
            | and have put myself in a position to excel and grow in my university coursework in the next coming semesters. 
            |  I am currently a member of AITP and the Computer Science Club at UH, and am a member of Women Who Code - Houston.  
            |  For the past several semesters, I have been a 4.0 student and plan to work hard to continue this throughout my college career.
